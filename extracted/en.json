Power doesn't need to be associated only with something negative. Only with certain power you're able to accomplish significant objectives, like in an organization. Only people who have certain levels of power make decisions which impact many others. It's a wise decision to invest in developing the skill of power. The more skillful you are, the more chances you'll have to sell your vision and ideas.",

  "dict.values.relationships.description": "The most priceless thing a person can have.. is someone else, who regardless of how often they connect, they know they can turn to for help and support, when most needed. Obviously, this ideally works both ways. The people who have relationships built on trust and understanding, enjoy one of the biggest values which human beings can have - true relationship. Healthy relationships contribute to wellbeing, and happier and healthier lives. Don't forget: \"Shared joy is double joy, shared sorrow is half a sorrow.\"",

Yet, it's not just about that. It's crucial to do it in the right way, as well. Being reliable means you need to build trust in other people, too. Being truthful is a good start. Promised things have to be done on time. If it's not possible, then clear communication is a must. Then, everyone is aware of what's happening and doubts are gone. When someone wants to be seen as reliable, he or she needs to be authentic, period.",

When we succeed, our brain triggers a surge of dopamine - a chemical reaction which fills us with warmth and happiness. We must set a few reachable daily goals, so we can enjoy the feeling of success - from making the bed in the morning to doing something good for mind and body. Daily. And don't be afraid to set harder and more time consuming, yet meaningful, goals for yourself. The more challenging the goal is, the better the outcome tastes. Once reached, you'll look back and be proud of yourself.",

  "dict.values.trust.description": "To earn trust is a long and sometimes complicated process. On the other hand, it can be too easily lost. Trust is built in little moments and in actions rather than in gestures. Trust means that someone recognizes you're worth listening to, that your truth and story matters. To be trustworthy you need to be transparent and accountable, be open to others and serve others. So how do we earn trust? Deliver on your promises, keep your word, show up on time, and don't gossip :-) No one wants to see themselves as another's subject of gossip. Create that which you yourself need and want in your own life.",

That would be a sad life, wouldn't it? :-) It's almost not possible to be 100% truthful, yet hold it as one of your biggest priorities and the fight for truth can be a moral commitment for us all. The truth matters both in science and personal relationships. It's the foundation for a fair and just society. And, most importantly, we need to take care that we're true to ourselves. We may decide to accept that others may fool us, yet we must not accept that we fool ourselves.",

  "dict.values.work.description": "To have meaningful work is not good just for our minds, yet also for our health. We must try to have at least a little bit of joy in what we're do for a living. If there is a period in life when things aren't aligned, never lose hope and energy to continue to move forward toward a better place. Yes, we'll consider decisions about our careers wisely, because we have certain responsibilities, yet, striving for something better needs to always be deeply within us. No matter what, work does continue to have plenty of benefits, regardless - besides rewarding us financially, it contributes to our self-confidence, meaning in our lives, and wellbeing. It plays a significant role in socialization and building a network of contacts that grow us in varying ways. Moreover, it gives us a sense of pride and being a part of something.",
