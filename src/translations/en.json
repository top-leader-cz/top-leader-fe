  "dict.values.fairness.description": "It's important for you to see that people are treated equally and no one is left out. You value things like honesty and trust. People who are fair to each other help create a respectful environment. Problems are solved much easier when people are honest with each other.

People who value patience are most likely calm, wise and perhaps experienced human beings. You have something to show and teach immature people around you. Have patience with their lack of patience :-).",

Power doesn't need to be associated only with something negative. Only with certain power you're able to accomplish significant objectives, like in an organization. Only people who have certain levels of power make decisions which impact many others. It's a wise decision to invest in developing the skill of power. The more skillful you are, the more chances you'll have to sell your vision and ideas.",
