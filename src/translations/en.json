  "dict.values.beauty.description": "Beauty doesn't necessarily mean just pretty. Beauty is about a greater sense of eloquence and elegance. It's a way to peak the interest of others. Beauty is also a symbol of progress. In its presence you feel more alive. It has the power to energize and dazzle you. Who doesn't like to be amazed? :-)",
  "dict.values.environment.description": "You feel connected to nature, to the environment around you. That's nice for you, not everyone has it like this. There's a significant responsibility that you feel as a human being regarding the environment. Now more than ever, the world needs people who value nature as you do, and even a little daily action towards sustainability and helping the environment is positive. Just keep doing good work!",
  "dict.values.fairness.description": "It's important for you to see that people are treated equally and no one is left out. You value things like honesty and trust. People who are fair to each other help create a respectful environment. Problems are solved much easier when people are honest with each other. A society that is fair and equal also helps improve other public factors - people who have equal opportunity are better able to contribute to the community and to its prosperity. A fair society also helps to reduce social and economic disadvantages. Yes, fairness matters!",
  "dict.values.independence.description": "For those who don't lean towards strict dependency, it's important to keep some kind of freedom and independence, at least in our own minds. All of us are born into societies which are more or less tied to certain constraints and limits. Independence goes along with creativity, open-mindness, and critical thinking which is very important nowadays in this complicated world. It helps to be in contact with similar thinking people. Life will be more vivid this way.",
  "dict.values.patience.description": "It takes strong will and self-control to wait for something to happen. Usually, the more important something is for you, the more patient you are. Yet, there are some people who want something to happen and just can't wait for it. It's important for you to understand that everything needs its time. People who value patience are most likely calm, wise and perhaps experienced human beings. You have something to show and teach immature people around you. Have patience with their lack of patience :-).",
  "dict.values.power.description": "You don't like to sit in the corner, do you? Having influence on something or someone is what drives you. Power doesn't need to be associated only with something negative. Only with certain power you're able to accomplish significant objectives, like in an organization. Only people who have certain levels of power make decisions which impact many others. It's a wise decision to invest in developing the skill of power. The more skillful you are, the more chances you'll have to sell your vision and ideas.",
