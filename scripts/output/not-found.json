This is why health is one of the top values for many of us. If we're not ok, all other values like family, relationships, etc. are negatively effected. Keep taking care of your vitality.",

Yet, you're also perhaps aware that there are things which money can't buy. Being focused on wealth doesn't mean it's the only thing you need to be focused on. Also, take time to look at other possibilities around you. Perhaps, contribute to something positive in your community, and not necessarily with money.

Yet, it's not just about that. It's crucial to do it in the right way, as well. Being reliable means you need to build trust in other people, too. Being truthful is a good start.

  "dict.values.teamwork.title": "Teamwork (Support, Cooperation)",
  "dict.values.trust.description": "To earn trust is a long and sometimes complicated process. On the other hand, it can be too easily lost. Trust is built in little moments and in actions rather than in gestures. Trust means that someone recognizes you're worth listening to, that your truth and story matters. To be trustworthy you need to be transparent and accountable, be open to others and serve others. So how do we earn trust? Deliver on your promises, keep your word, show up on time, and don't gossip :-) No one wants to see themselves as another's subject of gossip. Create that which you yourself need and want in your own life.",
  "dict.values.trust.title": "Trust (Respect, Dignity)",

That would be a sad life, wouldn't it? :-) It's almost not possible to be 100% truthful, yet hold it as one of your biggest priorities and the fight for truth can be a moral commitment for us all. The truth matters both in science and personal relationships. It's the foundation for a fair and just society. And, most importantly, we need to take care that we're true to ourselves.

Yes, we'll consider decisions about our careers wisely, because we have certain responsibilities, yet, striving for something better needs to always be deeply within us. No matter what, work does continue to have plenty of benefits, regardless - besides rewarding us financially, it contributes to our self-confidence, meaning in our lives, and wellbeing.
